# Documentation index

This page is a lightweight entrypoint for the docs site (kept in `docs/` to avoid conflicts with the repository root `README.md`).

Key guides

- Getting started: `getting-started.md`
- Policy architecture: `policy-architecture.md`
- Compliance maps: `compliance-maps.md`
- Kubernetes policies: `k8s-policies.md`
- Coverage report (generated): `coverage.md`
- Security & provenance: `security-provenance.md`

Developer & contribution links

- Contribution guide: `../CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Code of Conduct: `../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Security: `../SECURITY.md`

How this page is used

- Placed under `Extras` in the site navigation so it is discoverable from the docs site without conflicting with `index.md`.
- If you want this content to replace the repo root `README.md`, move or copy it to the repository root.

For more detailed instructions and references, use the main navigation on the left of the site.
