Single-maintainer note: repository currently has one maintainer.
Add new maintainers via PR, then expand `CODEOWNERS` with finer-grained rules.

Guidelines:

- Prefer opening an issue before large changes.
- Use PR reviews for all nonâ€‘trivial edits (policies, compliance maps, tooling).
- Security or sensitive supply chain concerns: use the process in `SECURITY.md` instead of public issues.

Format: keep the table alphabetically sorted by Name.
