## Where to Ask

- General questions / discussions: open an Issue labeled question or discussion.
- Bug: open an Issue with clear reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, tool versions.
- Feature / idea: open an Issue describing the motivation and usage scenario.

## Pre-Issue Checklist

- Read `docs/getting-started.md` and `docs/README.md`.
- Run local checks: `make validate`, `make test`.
- Run linters: `make lint-yaml`, `make lint-py`.
- For Kyverno / Gatekeeper policies, use tests under `tests/`.

## SLA & Priorities

- This is an open source project with limited maintainer time; no guaranteed response times.
- Security issues: use the private channel (see `SECURITY.md`) - highest priority.
